### Instalation

Before running the server there is a need to configure database settings.

If you already installed mysqlclient just go to settings.py file and find DATABASES section and configure it, otherwise mysqlclient should be downloaded.

###### To do this open terminal and type:

(for windows) `pip install mysqlclient`
(for linux) `pip3 install mysqlclient`

###### In case command above does not work:
For Python 3.8: 
For linux OS you can also install the package in the project:

Run in terminal: `pip3 install mysqlclient-2.0.1-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl`

For Windows OS you can also install the package in the project:

 Run in terminal: `pip install mysqlclient-1.4.6-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl`

            
###### Next run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

###### To run the server: `py manage.py runserver`

###### For unapplied migrations for Windows OS run in terminal:
`py manage.py makemigrations`

`py manage.py migrate`
    
###### For Linux OS:
`python3 manage.py makemigrations`

`python3 manage.py migrate`


###### To make new translations in terminal:
